# share
stuff I remember to share, do whatever the fuck you want with my stuff if you don't do anything shitty with it.


Seriously though, I doubt I write or share anything intentionally harmful, but if you decide to copy any of my shit into something that's harmful in any way I have to say Fuck You and leave my shit alone. I am not good at coding and if you somehow need something I write to hurt/attack/annoy or anything negative towards any person/entity/corpration/government or what the fuck ever, then fuck you. I give full permission to people to outright copy my stuff into something they think they can make money off(give me a shoutout and/or some beer money please) or just use it as a basis to write something better or worse. I really don't care what anyone does with anything I make unless they use it for harm or make it something to be used for harm.


Be chill and have fun.
